<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, 
  since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, 
  data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. 
  As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. 
You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.</p>

<h3>System Description</h3>
<p>The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts 
  a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. 
  Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June
  2023 to August 2023. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Explain the purpose of the information system</h3>
<b>Purpose</b>
<p>The database server is like a big computer that keeps lots of information in one place. It stores things like customer details, marketing plans, and data used 
  to understand how well things are working. Making sure this computer is safe and protected is super important because it's used a lot for marketing tasks. Hence, 
  it shouldn't be made public.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Identify potential threat sources, threat even and calculate the risk of potential threats</h3>
<p>Explore the Threat sources section of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource. Using what you know about the vulnerable database server, notice the threat types and examples described.</p>

<b>Risk Assessment</b>
<pre>Threat Source: Customers <br>Threat Event: Customers can delete critical data. <br>Likelihood = 1 Severity = 2 Risk = 3</pre>
<pre>Threat Source: Malicious Attacker/Hackers <br>Threat Event: Hackers can steal critical data. <br>Likelihood = 3 Severity =3 Risk = 9</pre>
<pre>Threat Source: Employees <br>Threat Event: Employees can misuse critical data and/or mistakenly expose company's critical data/assets. <br>Likelihood = 2 Severity = 3 Risk = 6</pre>

<h3>Step 3: Explain your approach</h3>
<b>Approach</b>
<p>We looked at how the business stores and manages data to figure out possible dangers. We found out what could cause security problems by looking at how likely 
  they were with the system's permissions. Then we compared how bad these problems could be with how they might affect the business's daily operations.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Propose a remediation strategy</h3>
<b>Remediation Strategy</b>
<p>The remediation strategy we used was setting up ways to make sure that only the right people can get into the database. This means using strong passwords, controlling who can do what with 
  roles (Principle of least Privilege), and adding extra layers of security like using more than just a password to log in. Also, keeping the information safe while it's being sent around by 
  using a secure method called TLS. We'll also make sure that only people from certain offices can connect to the database, so random internet users can't get in.</p>
