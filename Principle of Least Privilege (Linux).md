<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.</p>

<b>Step 1: Check File and Directory Details</b>
<p>Important commands to consider when checking files and directory privileges/permissions:</p>
<b>
  1. ls - We use ls to display files and directories (sub-directories) in the current working directory, <br>
  2. ls -l - We use ls -l to display file and directory permissions. <br>
  3. ls -a - We use ls -a to display hidden files. <br>
  4. ls -la - We use ls -la to display file and directory permissions, including hidden files. <br>
